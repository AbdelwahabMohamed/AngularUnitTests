notes:
-----
-use angular.mock.module to configure mocked modules
-use angular.mock.inject to load mocked modules, services, etc.... this will bootstrab the application allowing us 
to get instances of any thing in the modules that has been configured by the application by name
-it will load in sequence Angular -> ngMock -> all configured modules
- _[something]_ naming convention if we passed the function name x or _x_ , the inject will try to load something called x from the
pre-configured module.
-When using $http within a test, ngMock replaces the $httpBackendProvider with a mocked one, so no real http calles are made
that means we have to configure the mocked backend provider ourselves.

-jasmine afterEach -> verifyNoOutstandingExpectation() to make sure that all the http calls in the tests have a 
configured expectations and responses.

-jasmine afterEach -> verifyNoOutstandingRequest() to make sure that all the http calls were flushed successfully.


-ngMock cotroller service $controller(constructor, locals, [bindings])
