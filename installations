notes:
-----
-use angular.mock.module to configure mocked modules
-use angular.mock.inject to load mocked modules, services, etc.... this will bootstrab the application allowing us 
to get instances of any thing in the modules that has been configured by the application by name
-it will load in sequence Angular -> ngMock -> all configured modules
- _[something]_ naming convention if we passed the function name x or _x_ , the inject will try to load something called x from the
pre-configured module.
